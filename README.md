Hacking scripts for the bitburner game

/hack contatins scripts for hacking and creating servers. These will run in the background

/scripts contains scripts that just run once

/ext contains scripts I have stole from other players

/inc contains include files where I keep resued functions such as getServers 

/bin contains scripts that you probably want to make an alias of to turn them into commands

/contracts contains the scripts I stole to auto solve contracts

Enjoy!
